#### Understand more about how your customers pay with the Square block.

Looker’s Square block has been built to help you find insights that matter and to do more with your transaction data. Whether you use Square as a POS, mobile merchant platform, or CRM, this block may help you achieve the following:

- Keep an eye on your business’ recent transactions
- Understand when and how your customers pay
- Drill into the activity and performance of specific store locations
- Analyze your customer spending patterns
- Monitor your store’s inventory and item popularity over time
- Learn what your most popular order variants are
- Track how long it takes for orders to close
- See how your store’s revenue changes

As with other Looker blocks, you can easily customize the data model to fit your business needs. Use the Orders Explore to tailor the included dashboards on Orders, Shops, and Transactions to fit your use case or to create your own dashboards and reports.
